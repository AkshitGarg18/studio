/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All application
 * data is stored in a user-centric hierarchy, ensuring that users can only access their
 * own information. This creates a secure, private data island for each user.
 *
 * Data Structure: The entire data model is organized under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 * Each user's document serves as the root for their private subcollections, including
 * `dailyProgress`, `streaks`, and `notifications`. This structure is inherently secure
 * and performant for user-specific queries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration is Disallowed: The top-level `/users` collection is not listable,
 *   preventing malicious actors from discovering the list of all users.
 * - Strict Path-Based Ownership: All rules rely on the `{userId}` wildcard in the path
 *   to grant access, meaning a user can only ever interact with documents inside their
 *   own data tree.
 * - Relational Integrity: On document creation, rules validate that the internal `userId`
 *   field matches the `userId` in the document path, ensuring data consistency. This
 *   field is then enforced as immutable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: This ruleset leverages the Firestore path as the
 * primary source of truth for authorization. By nesting all data under a user's ID, we
 * avoid costly and complex `get()` or `exists()` calls to other documents, resulting in
 * faster and simpler security rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Each data type (e.g., progress, streaks, notifications) is
 * stored in its own dedicated subcollection under the user. This segregation simplifies
 * rules and allows for secure, targeted list operations within each user's data scope.
