    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure user data privacy and efficient data retrieval, while adhering to the principles of Authorization Independence, Structural Segregation, and Access Modeling. Each user has a dedicated collection for their profile data, daily progress, and streak information, allowing for simplified security rules based on path-based ownership.\n\n*   **UserProfile Collection (`/users/{userId}/profile`)**: Stores user profile information. This path ensures that only the authenticated user can access their own profile data.\n*   **Daily Progress Collection (`/users/{userId}/dailyProgress/{dailyProgressId}`)**: Stores the daily progress entries for each user. The `userId` parameter in the path ensures that only the user can access their progress data. The `dailyProgressId` is a unique identifier for each daily progress entry.\n*   **Streak Collection (`/users/{userId}/streak`)**: Stores the user's streak information. This path ensures that only the authenticated user can access their own streak data. Since each user has only one streak document, a document ID is not explicitly required.\n\nThis structure supports the required QAPs by:\n\n*   **Authorization Independence:** Each document's access control is determined solely by its path and the authenticated user's ID, eliminating the need for `get()` calls to parent documents.\n*   **Structural Segregation:** Each collection contains data with the same access needs (user-owned data), simplifying security rules.\n\nThis design promotes a scalable and secure data structure for the Streak Keeper application."
